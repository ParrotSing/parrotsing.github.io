A large bird <br soft>spooked Arielle, and she jumped from my shoulder and flew into <br soft>the wind. Her flight took her away from me over a portion of the <br soft>water and back toward some tall trees; as she flew, nearby <br soft>shrubs and trees farther away blocked my line of sight. I ran and <br soft>searched several blocks adjacent to the park because Arielle <br soft>had achieved considerable altitude as she flew. Many minutes <br soft>later, a man approached and showed me where Arielle was <br soft>perched. I had overestimated how far she had flown, probably <br soft>because my flustered mind was not thinking clearly. Against the <br soft>green needles of a pine tree, my macaw blended in well enough <br soft>that it was not obvious where she was, unless one was looking <br soft>directly at her.<br><br>She had landed on a tree branch more than 30 feet above <br soft>ground. I called home from a house adjacent to the park and <br soft>asked my wife, Pat, to bring my rescue kit to retrieve Arielle <br soft>from the tree. Pat arrived with my long pole, a T-bar perch that I <br soft>had built, rope, and other paraphernalia. The pole extended to <br soft>20 feet and, with a T-perch attached the total length was about <br soft>two feet longer. Held at arm's length above my head, I could <br soft>reach greater than 30 feet above the ground. Thirty feet was not <br soft>high enough.<br><br>The man who helped me suggested that I could use a<br>table to secure additional height. I improvised a four-foot ladder <br soft>by upturning an easily moved wire trash container and stood on <br soft>it. Reaching upwards upon tiptoes, I could hoist the bar of the <br soft>T-perch level with the branch upon which Arielle stood.<br><br>I strained to lift and counter the torque exerted by the<br>pole as I held it above my head. A group of bystanders gathered <br soft>to watch, as I guided the quivering pole amongst the branches of <br soft>the tree. The trash barrel swayed under my weight frustrating <br soft>my ability to control the rescue device. It was challenging to <br soft>control the motion as a<br>small movement near the fulcrum caused a much larger<br>one at the end of the fully-extended pole. My support was <br soft>imprecisely positioned under Arielle's position. The <br soft>misalignment &nbsp;required that I hold the long pole off vertical, and <br soft>most of the weight was well above my head. It was exerting work <br soft>and perspiration dripped from my head. I extended my arms <br soft>upward at an angle and strained my wrists to apply sufficient <br soft>torque to manipulate the elevated T-perch. After nearly stepping <br soft>off the edge of the trash bin, I gyrated the apparatus in front of <br soft>my bird briefly.<br><br>The pole oscillated uncontrollably. I released the contraption <br soft>and repositioned it for another rescue attempt. Training a bird <br soft>does pay off. With my heart racing and the sound of my pulse in <br soft>my ears, I commanded Arielle to step upon the T-perch. &quot;UP!&quot; I <br soft>shouted in the calmest sounding, most businesslike, voice I <br soft>could muster. Arielle raised her leg; she was going to step onto <br soft>the perch.<br><br>As soon as she mounted the perch, I guided the pole away from <br soft>the limb upon which she perched and out of grabbing range of <br soft>other branches. With a wrist wrenching motion, I slowly lowered <br soft>the pole to bring my bird closer. In a few seconds, I removed her <br soft>from the T-bar and she returned to her normal position on my <br soft>shoulder. As I jumped from the makeshift ladder to the ground, I <br soft>scolded Arielle. The next morning I trimmed her flight feathers <br soft>shorter to prevent a repetition of the previous day's flight. <br soft>(September 1997)<br><br>P.S.: I recommend that beginning parrot owners use a tether if <br soft>they want to take their birds outside. </span></font></b><b><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;">Only a disciplined parrot <br soft>owner, who has practiced walking with and rescuing his bird <br soft>outdoors, should attempt to handle an unrestrained parrot <br soft>outside</span></font></b><b><font color="#663300" size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;">.

As we <br soft>continued walking, after thought the word <br soft>that fit her utterance came to mind, &#8220;goblin.&#8221;<br><br>How had she learned to relate the <br soft>ornamentation to that word?
