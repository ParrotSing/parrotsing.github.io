Part of the problem is reflected by a statement <br soft>about &quot;inattentional deafness&quot; by Temple Grandin in <br soft></span></font></b><b><i><font color="#663300" size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;">Animals in Translation</span></font></i></b><b><font color="#663300" size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;">.<br><br>A listener must be interested enough to determine the <br soft>message transmitted by a speaking bird. Since many bird <br soft>owners neither actively listen to their birds nor pay much <br soft>attention to the bird's speech, who then will receive the <br soft>bird's message?<br><br>Many people enjoy hearing a parrot repeat stock phrases. <br soft>However, the novelty wears off soon and then the<br>difficulty becomes apparent; people assume that a bird's <br soft>early speech is not meaningful, but they are often wrong. <br soft>An owner needs to recognize and explore the bird's<br>ability to use language during &quot;a window of opportunity,&quot; <br soft>usually during the bird's early dealings with its owner. <br soft>Future communicative opportunities might be lost,<br>because a bird simply gives up when it receives no <br soft>response. Out of boredom, parrots revert to repeating <br soft>mundane phrases that cause a reaction.<br><br>If you listen to your bird and work with your bird, there is<br>a much higher chance that you will be able to communicate <br soft>at least on occasion. For example, Arielle learned to ask, <br soft>&quot;Hurt?&quot; The word is posed with a rising pitch to indicate <br soft>the questioning nature of the utterance. The full translation <br soft>for her abbreviated question is: &quot;Is that something that is <br soft>likely to hurt me?&quot; (Linguists call such words holophrases; <br soft>in such utterances, a single word expresses a basic <br soft>sentence.)<br><br>My surprising finding is that people generally do not <br soft>comprehend Arielle's speech, at least not the isolated <br soft>taped speech of my macaw. Why is that?<br><br>A child's parents usually understand their offspring's <br soft>irregular speech, but a befuddled stranger often finds the <br soft>child's speech incomprehensible. A parrot is considerably <br soft>smaller than an adult human and has vocal characteristics <br soft>similar to that of a toddler. The bird's voice emanates<br>from its syrinx, which generates sound in a considerably <br soft>different way from a human vocal tract. I believe these <br soft>factors combined with those presented in the list above <br soft>explain why people find understanding recordings of bird <br soft>speech difficult. I work at analyzing Arielle's unclear <br soft>speech.<br><br>What is surprising is the lack of interest in bird speech <br soft>among parrot owners. Many enthusiasts buy a talking<br>bird specifically for its ability to speak. Yet the typical <br soft>owner, as well as the general public, is not tremendously <br soft>interested in what a bird says or whether it communicates. <br soft>People don't try hard enough to comprehend bird speech, <br soft>and, as a result, they miss the exhilarating experience of <br soft>hearing cognitive speech by their bird.<br><br>One has to work to develop an appreciation for the <br soft>messages transmitted by birds. Learning to transcribe a <br soft>parrot's speech has been likened to learning a foreign <br soft>language. People generally accommodate strangers <br soft>attempting to speak English with a foreign accent. Yet, <br soft>listeners are reluctant to grant the same courtesy to a <br soft>talking bird that speaks with an accent. The least we can <br soft>do is work to determine words spoken by a bird, because<br>a parrot exerts an enormous effort to learn human <br soft>language and to communicate in an unfamiliar way. The <br soft>study of words spoken by a parrot is worthwhile. Parrots <br soft>like Arielle try to communicate a range of information to <br soft>their owners. One story about a communication by Arielle <br soft>is reproduced on the </span></font></b><a href="MacawSpeech.html"><b><font size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;">MacawSpeech</span></font></b></a><b><font color="#663300" size="3"><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:19px;"> page of this site.<br><br>Owners who listen intently will find that their talking<br>birds are trying to communicate. Bird keepers can learn<br>how to listen to parrot speech in order to decode the <br soft>message. This is sometimes a daunting task, but one<br>that will be greatly rewarded for the effort.<br><br>We don't have to look to outer space for intelligent life with <br soft>which to communicate.

Without notes,<br>it is almost impossible to determine anything <br soft>unusual said by the bird. A basic reporting <br soft>system for words uttered by a bird is sufficient.<br><br>The simplest method is to write a file card for <br soft>each utterance and file entries in a box, or<br>one can jot sayings into alphabetized sections <br soft>of a notebook. In either case, owners create a <br soft>mechanism to refer to words, phrases, and <br soft>sentences spoken by their bird. Keep track<br>of the date for each entry with notes about<br>new additions.<br><br>I'd like to learn about your results, because <br soft>the data is scarce about the rate of growth for <br soft>a bird's vocabulary. You might be surprised,<br>as I was, to learn that a bird can learn words <br soft>faster than young children!<br><br>Many people will convert their records to a <br soft>computer database. Electronic filing makes it <br soft>easier to sort unique entries, to count the <br soft>entries, and to order and print the list in <br soft>different formats.<br><br>Regardless of how you keep your records, it's <br soft>a good idea to have an accounting for your <br soft>bird's speech. There are several reasons. <br soft>First, each bird's education provides an <br soft>unusual way to identify one's pet. There is the <br soft>likelihood that the world will learn more about <br soft>the capabilities of talking birds if you have a <br soft>written record for your bird's vocabulary. <br soft>Memory is unreliable. There is another<br>reason too. It is hard for some people to <br soft>imagine, but we humans can learn about birds <br soft>and from birds, as a result of their speaking <br soft>ability.<br><br>One of the most important records to keep is<br>a list of the &nbsp;parrot's hard-to-understand <br soft>sayings. You may have to use blanks for <br soft>unknown words, or you may use another<br>word as a place marker. I call such words <br soft>&quot;sononyms.&quot; Sometimes after months of <br soft>thinking about what Arielle said, I come to <br soft>understand the meaning for her words.<br><br>You are likely to be surprised by some of the <br soft>things that your bird says.
